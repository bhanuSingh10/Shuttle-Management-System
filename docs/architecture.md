# Architecture Trade-offs - Shuttle Management System

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural decisions made for the Shuttle Management System and their trade-offs.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Next.js Full-Stack Approach
**Decision**: Use Next.js for both frontend and backend instead of separate services.

**Pros**:
- Simplified deployment and development
- Shared TypeScript types between frontend/backend
- Built-in optimizations (SSR, code splitting)
- Single codebase maintenance

**Cons**:
- Monolithic architecture limits independent scaling
- Harder to use different technologies for different services
- All-or-nothing deployment strategy

**Alternative Considered**: Separate React frontend + Express/Fastify backend
**Why Rejected**: Added complexity without clear benefits at current scale

### Database Choice: PostgreSQL with Prisma
**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM instead of NoSQL or raw SQL.

**Pros**:
- ACID compliance for financial transactions (wallet)
- Strong typing with Prisma
- Excellent tooling and migration support
- Relational data fits the domain well

**Cons**:
- Potentially overkill for simple CRUD operations
- ORM abstraction can hide performance issues
- Vertical scaling limitations

**Alternative Considered**: MongoDB with Mongoose
**Why Rejected**: Financial data requires ACID transactions

### Authentication: JWT with HTTP-only Cookies
**Decision**: Use JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies instead of localStorage or sessions.

**Pros**:
- Stateless authentication
- XSS protection with HTTP-only cookies
- Works well with SSR
- No server-side session storage needed

**Cons**:
- Larger cookie size than session IDs
- Token revocation complexity
- CSRF considerations (mitigated with SameSite)

**Alternative Considered**: Server-side sessions with Redis
**Why Rejected**: Added infrastructure complexity

## Data Architecture

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: In-memory LRU cache instead of Redis.

**Pros**:
- No additional infrastructure
- Lower latency for cached data
- Simpler deployment

**Cons**:
- Cache doesn't survive server restarts
- No cache sharing between instances
- Memory usage on application server

**Alternative Considered**: Redis for caching
**Why Rejected**: Premature optimization for current scale

### File Storage
**Decision**: No file storage implemented (would use Vercel Blob).

**Pros**:
- Serverless-friendly
- Automatic CDN distribution
- No infrastructure management

**Cons**:
- Vendor lock-in
- Cost at scale
- Limited control over storage

## API Design

### RESTful API vs GraphQL
**Decision**: RESTful API with Next.js Route Handlers.

**Pros**:
- Simpler to implement and understand
- Better caching with HTTP semantics
- Smaller bundle size
- Built-in with Next.js

**Cons**:
- Over-fetching/under-fetching data
- Multiple requests for related data
- Less flexible for complex queries

**Alternative Considered**: GraphQL with Apollo
**Why Rejected**: Added complexity without clear benefits

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: HTTP status codes with JSON error responses.

**Pros**:
- Standard HTTP semantics
- Easy to handle in frontend
- Good tooling support

**Cons**:
- Limited error context
- No error categorization
- Basic error recovery

## Frontend Architecture

### State Management
**Decision**: SWR for server state, React state for UI state.

**Pros**:
- Automatic caching and revalidation
- Optimistic updates
- Background refetching
- Small bundle size

**Cons**:
- Learning curve for complex scenarios
- Limited offline support
- No global client state management

**Alternative Considered**: Redux Toolkit Query
**Why Rejected**: Overkill for current requirements

### Styling Approach
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components.

**Pros**:
- Rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Small production bundle
- Great developer experience

**Cons**:
- HTML can become verbose
- Learning curve for team
- Potential design inconsistencies

**Alternative Considered**: Styled Components or CSS Modules
**Why Rejected**: Slower development velocity

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
**Decision**: Zod for runtime validation on both client and server.

**Pros**:
- Type-safe validation
- Shared schemas between frontend/backend
- Great TypeScript integration
- Runtime safety

**Cons**:
- Bundle size impact
- Validation logic duplication
- Performance overhead

### CORS and CSRF Protection
**Decision**: SameSite cookies with Next.js built-in CSRF protection.

**Pros**:
- Built-in protection
- No additional configuration
- Works with SSR

**Cons**:
- Limited cross-domain scenarios
- Browser compatibility considerations

## Performance Trade-offs

### Server-Side Rendering
**Decision**: Use SSR for public pages, CSR for authenticated pages.

**Pros**:
- Better SEO for public pages
- Faster initial page load
- Progressive enhancement

**Cons**:
- Increased server load
- Complexity in data fetching
- Hydration issues potential

### Bundle Optimization
**Decision**: Automatic code splitting with Next.js.

**Pros**:
- Smaller initial bundles
- Lazy loading of routes
- Better caching strategies

**Cons**:
- Potential loading delays
- Complexity in shared dependencies

## Scalability Decisions

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
**Decision**: Design for vertical scaling initially, horizontal later.

**Pros**:
- Simpler architecture
- Lower operational complexity
- Faster development

**Cons**:
- Single point of failure
- Limited scaling ceiling
- Harder to scale specific components

### Database Scaling Strategy
**Decision**: Single database instance with connection pooling.

**Pros**:
- Simpler data consistency
- No distributed transaction complexity
- Lower operational overhead

**Cons**:
- Single point of failure
- Limited read scaling
- Potential bottleneck

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging Strategy
**Decision**: Console logging with structured JSON in production.

**Pros**:
- Simple implementation
- Works with Vercel's logging
- Easy to parse and analyze

**Cons**:
- Limited log aggregation
- No distributed tracing
- Basic error tracking

**Alternative Considered**: Structured logging with Winston
**Why Rejected**: Added complexity for current needs

## Future Architectural Improvements

### Microservices Migration Path
1. Extract payment service
2. Separate analytics service
3. Independent user management
4. Event-driven communication

### Performance Optimizations
1. Implement Redis caching
2. Add database read replicas
3. Use CDN for static assets
4. Implement background job processing

### Security Enhancements
1. Add rate limiting
2. Implement audit logging
3. Add API versioning
4. Enhanced input sanitization

## Conclusion

The current architecture prioritizes simplicity and development velocity over premature optimization. Most trade-offs favor rapid development and deployment while maintaining reasonable performance and security standards. The architecture can evolve incrementally as the system scales and requirements become clearer.
